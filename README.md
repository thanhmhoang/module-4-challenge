# Module-4-Challenge

## Description

For this Module 4 Challenge, the challege was to build a timed quiz with multiple choice questions. The quiz will test the knowledge of user on music festivals as msuic festival season approaches especially with a very popular one named Coachella. Once the user completes the quiz, high scores will be stored so that users can see how they have progressed or how they rank against their peers. This application will run in the browser and will contain HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. Through doing this challenge, I was able to have a better understanding of how to use JavaScript and how to create functions, set variables, use for loops, store data locally, and working with APIs.
